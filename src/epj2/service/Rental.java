	 * It executes the rental simulation by moving the vehicle along the path from start to end location.
	 * This method performs the following actions:
	 * -Calculates the path the vehicle will take from the starting location to the ending location.
	 * -Determines the time required to traverse each cell in the path.
	 * -Randomly selects a point in the path where a fault may occur.
	 * -Iterates through the path, updating the vehicle's position on the map display.
	 * -Simulates the vehicle's movement, adjusting the battery level and handling the charging process if necessary.
	 * -Checks if the vehicle encounters a fault at any point in the path and updates the fault information.
	 * -After the vehicle completes its movement, it checks whether it has traveled through the wider area of the city. 
	 * -A bill is then generated and delivered to the user. Additionally, a message is printed to the console indicating that 
	 *  the vehicle has finished its movement.
	 *  
	 * During execution:
	 * -If the vehicle's battery level drops below or equals 20%, it pauses for a charging period before continuing.
	 * -The simulation takes into account the distance covered for bikes to properly update their battery level.
	 * -The method captures the last position of the vehicle for proper display updates and fault handling.
